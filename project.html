            <h4>Origin of Rice</h4>
            <p>My best food in and out of season remains jollof rice.
                The exact place rice originated from is still controversial. </p>
            <p>There are different schools of thought regarding the origin of rice.
                Some are of the opinion that rice was one of the variants of wild grasses
                cultivated in Himalayas hence its ancestry is traced there. </p>
            Some others believe rice came to be through the Southern Indians,
            from where it spread to other Asian countries.
            <p> The converging point of the different views
                lies in unanimous agreement
                that the spread however was birthed through socialization. </p>
